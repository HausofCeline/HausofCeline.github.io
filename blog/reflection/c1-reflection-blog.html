    <h1>What's your take?</h1>
    This seems to be one of the most comprehensive learning experiences. It should lay a solid foundation for the contination of my journey with programming.

    <h2>What are your impressions?</h2>
    It feels very supportive.
    I am often inspired to create, on multiple levels. So I feel comfortable that I can come into this environment 
    ready with questions and an open mind.
    The kitchen metaphor is apt as I've had a catering company and worked in many kitchens; I like to be hands-on.
    I recognize there will be many types of personalities and skill-levels working and exploring and creating, 
    and this excites me. 

    <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
    Just like my yoga practice, I approach every class and session as if I am a beginner. The empty teacup, if you will.
    everyone can learn something from someone.
    everyone can learn something from themselves.
    have fun. know when to surrender. breathe.
    I'm really excited to "go together" with my cohort into this learning experience, and to discover our strengths, 
    both individually and collectively.
    
 <h4> Have your expectations of EDA changed?</h4>
    No.

    <h5>Are you excited? Does it make you nervous?</h5>
    I'm always excited. Excitement is an expression of nervousness, I think. :) I'm ready.
