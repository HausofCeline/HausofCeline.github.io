    <h3>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h3>
    <p>While I have done a lot of reading and active practice related to emotional intelligence, I learned quite a bit from this scientific presentation. It was interesting to note that businesses, in fact, value this sort of emotional competency. It does not surprise me, as I know the ability to empathize is not only a gift, but a blessing. I would like to work on attention training, as I know myself to be a very emotional person. I find I have high competency in areas of self-knowledge, intuition, and empathy, however I definitely need to improve my self-mastery. The concept of neuralplasticity is also one of pervading interest to me.</p>
    <h3>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h3>
    <p>Taking time to "just be" is critical for well-being. Though I know this, of course I do not always put it to practice in my "busy" day-to-day. However, when I do take the moments- from two minutes to two hours, to breathe and just be in my body I invariably feel more calm and more connected to the world around me. I experience myself as not an "I" but simply as a being, existing in time-space in the grand composition of life. </p>
