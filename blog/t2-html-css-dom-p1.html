    <h3> Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h3>
<p> The DOM translates and verifies the HTML- it is how a browser translates a page. It cleans up code and checks for errors. HTML is a foundation. It is a skeleton structure. How many rooms. CSS is the styling. The color of the walls.</p>
<h3>What is meant by boxifying design? What is the box model?</h3>
<p> This is an organizational technique. It means to create "boxes" for every element on a webpage. this helps to organize the content and is critical for tidy code writing and presenting readable content.</p>
