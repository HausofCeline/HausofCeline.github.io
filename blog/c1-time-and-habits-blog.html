    <h1>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h1>

   <p> I have tried Meditation.I also employ many of the techniques listed in "counterintuitive" ideas. Such as forgetting what you know and focusing on positive tasks,
    And starting small.</p>

    <h2>What did you find interesting?</h2>
    
    <p>It's always interesting to read new ideas for productivity. Ironically, I still need help in this area.</p>

    <h3>What worked for you?</h3>
    
    <p>Meditation calms me, and at best- takes me to an elevated state. Immediately, this may not help with a task at hand
    but I believe it plays a role in granting focus for future projects.
</p>
    <h4>which will you experiment further with?</h4> 
    
    <p>I will experiment with the pomodoro technique. I like the idea of switching tasks after a certain alloted time.
    I think I need to be more broad in my approach with discipline techniques, especially as they pertain to independent-work-tasks like coding.
